                <h2>2023 Upcoming Games Release Schedule</h2>
                <p>2023 is shaping up to be an enormous year for video games, with many titles previously planned for
                    this year getting pushed into next. Big-name games like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom
                    and Diablo IV are coming in 2023, as are several high-profile remakes of classic games.

            <h2>Top 3 games</h2>
            <p class="p-title">1 - Resident Evil 4 Remake</p>
            <p>Release Date: 24 March 2023
                Platform(s): PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Windows PC</p>

            <p>Making use of the higher visual fidelity possible with the new generation of consoles, the almost
                20-year-old title appears to be filled with far more tension and horror moments that play on your
                expectations of what to expect. How will it handle the bonkers second half of the game? We'll just have
                to wait and see. </p>
            <p class="p-title">2 - Dead Island 2</p>

                Platform(s): PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Windows PC</p>

            <p>In this adventure, you're tasked with beating back infected zombies, surviving with a small band of
                immune humans, and winning back the entire city of Los Angeles through bloody and desperate fights.
                You'll have a range of weapons at your disposal to complete your mission, including a deadly katana,
                glass bottles, and a shotgun.
            </p>
            <p class="p-title">3 - Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</p>
            <p>Release Date: 28 April 2023
                Platform(s): PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Windows PC</p>
